# Basketball Analytics

This project that was done jointly with a professional basketball team in a major western basketball league. The collaboration was directly with the team's analytics group using a dataset that was provided by the league. The dataset consists of all ball and player movement data for two full seasons for all games played in the league. It also includes shot attempt data, the result of each attempt, and the time on the shot clock at each play. Players are identified by an anonymized id with player position (Center, Point Guard etc..) and height only provided. The location of each play/shot on the field is provided in a two dimensional space (long,lat). This analysis was done on a publicly available basketball touch dataset, which is a subset of the original dataset. this was done to avoid breaching any privacy agreements, while showing the value and insights available in the data.

The goals of the project were the following:
1) Identify the plays that contribute to better defence; defence is defined as an act that leads to a no shot attempt taken during a ball possession
2) Rank players based on their defensive performance by using the defensive plays above. The main concept is that the more important an defensive play is, the better defensive player the player who plays that play is

This project is broken down into the following parts:
1) Data exploration and visualization
2) Feature engineering and offensive play definition
3) Model creation and player ranking
